**Reflection:** What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?



**Important files to view:** lib/main.dart

**Instructions** to launch prototype:

1) Clone or download this repo, saving the files to a directory
2) Open terminal and CD into the directory of the downloaded files.
3) Open up terminal and enter:
>  flutter run
(Select which Chrome device in the terminal if prompted to)
4) Your Chrome browswer will automatically open up a link of form localhost:#####/

On the link, play around with the following features:
    1) Add a to-do list item by pressing the + button in the bottom left corner and typing in a task
    2) Check off the to-do list item by pressing the todo list item
    3) Press the trash icon to delete thetodo item.
